# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

Instead, report privately to the repository maintainers with:
- a description of the issue and potential impact
- minimal reproduction steps
- affected versions/commit (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.
