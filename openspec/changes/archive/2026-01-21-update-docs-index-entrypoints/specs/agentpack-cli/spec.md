## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Docs index provides fast onboarding entrypoints

The documentation index pages (`docs/index.md` and `docs/zh-CN/index.md`) SHALL provide prominent entrypoints so a new user can quickly choose between:
Quickstart, Import, Demo-5min, Compare, and Architecture.

#### Scenario: New user chooses a path within 30 seconds
- **GIVEN** a user opens the docs index page
- **WHEN** they scan the “start here” entrypoint section
- **THEN** they can find links to Quickstart, Import, Demo-5min, Compare, and Architecture without scrolling through unrelated sections
