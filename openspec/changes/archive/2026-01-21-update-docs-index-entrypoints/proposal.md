# Change: Strengthen docs/index entrypoints

## Why
New users should be able to choose the right documentation path quickly (quickstart vs import vs demo vs comparison vs architecture) without hunting through multiple pages.

## What Changes
- Update `docs/index.md` and `docs/zh-CN/index.md` to surface clear entrypoints for: Quickstart, Import, Demo-5min, Compare, and Architecture.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `agentpack-cli` (docs/discoverability surface)
- Affected code/docs: docs index pages only
- Compatibility: no CLI/JSON behavior changes
