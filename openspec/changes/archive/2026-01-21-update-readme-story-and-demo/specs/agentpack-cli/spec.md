## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: README explains why/when/how to use Agentpack

The repository SHALL include in its README (EN + zh-CN) three concrete usage scenarios, one end-to-end command loop demonstration, and an explicit link to the dotfiles-manager comparison page to clarify boundaries.

#### Scenario: New user can understand value and boundaries from README alone
- **GIVEN** a new user reads the README
- **WHEN** they scan the “Why” scenarios and the full-loop demo
- **THEN** they can understand what Agentpack is for, the typical workflow, and where to read more for dotfiles-manager comparisons
