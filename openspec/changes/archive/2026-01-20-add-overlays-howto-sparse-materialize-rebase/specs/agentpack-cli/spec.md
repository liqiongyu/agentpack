## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Overlays workflows are documented as a how-to

The repository SHALL include a task-oriented overlays how-to that covers the common workflow (create sparse overlay, optionally materialize for browsing, rebase after upstream updates, handle conflicts), and points users to patch overlays for small reviewable edits.

#### Scenario: Overlays how-to exists and is discoverable
- **WHEN** users look for overlays workflows from the docs entrypoint
- **THEN** they can find a how-to page describing sparse/materialize/rebase steps
