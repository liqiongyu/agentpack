# Change: Add targets capability matrix to docs

## Why
The per-target sections in `docs/reference/targets.md` are detailed, but new users often need a quick “at a glance” view to understand which targets support which module types and scopes.

## What Changes
- Add a concise capability matrix table to `docs/reference/targets.md` and `docs/zh-CN/reference/targets.md`.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `agentpack-cli` (docs/reference discoverability)
- Affected code/docs: docs only
- Compatibility: no CLI/JSON behavior changes
